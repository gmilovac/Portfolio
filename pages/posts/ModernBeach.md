# Modern Beach

This project is a final project for the EDIT CodeSchool in Fall of 2018 at 3rd Gymnasium Split. I was mostly working on the mini-game portion of the website and assisted with the content.

This project is a website that allows for users to check some of the most popular beaches in Croatia and find out more about them. The user can hover their pointer over one of the beach images and check the detail such as: size, water temperature, surface type, shops, bars... Most shown beaches are located in the Dalmatian area, and there are over 10 being listed.

Site also offers users a range of popular activities for each beach. Activities mentioned include: walking, running, tennis and badminton, cycling, picigin (old Dalmatian game played in shallow water), swimming, rock climbing and wind surfing. Users can also select and filter beaches based on the surface level they prefer (for example - picigin can only be played on sandy beaches).

In today's times, environmental pollution is more prevalent than ever due to the significant development in the industry that has been constantly and rapidly occurring over the past few centuries. People are increasingly neglecting nature, not considering all its beauty. This also affects beaches. Fortunately, such thinking is not prevalent in the Split-Dalmatia County, but we still need to be cautious because it's not difficult to destroy nature but rather hard to restore it. By encouraging people to have ecological awareness, we contribute to the natural wealth and the quality of our lives and ensure that our beaches remain some of the most beautiful in the world. That is precisely the purpose of the website we have created.

App offers 2 games for users to play. There is a Memory game featuring some of the most famous beaches, and there is a Battery percentage guesser game. Inside the text box, the user inputs the percentage of remaining battery in the following format - 59. The response is submitted using the 'Confirm' button. After 5 attempts, the result is displayed to the user along with an appropriate gif. A margin of error of 3% is allowed.

The team was considering working more on the website. Some considered implementations would be: real-time water and air temperature information, parking availability, a directory of hospitality establishments on the beach, and a rating system. Additionally, it would provide various statistics about the beaches. We believe that in this way, we can address many issues related to organization and accessibility of information.

This project won the "Best web design" national reward. Our team (Gordan Milovac - myself, Antionio Nikolic and Nino Borovic) was the first one to receive this prize. It was a great experience and I would recommend everyone to try it out.
