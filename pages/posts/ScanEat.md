# ScanEat

During my Summer 2023 internship I got an opportunity to assist the dobartek.hr team with the production of the ScanEat app. I was working with the iOS development team and assisted with Swift tasks.

If you scan a barcode of a product that is not in our database,
the application will ask you to take pictures of the product's packaging
from all sides. These images are then sent to the ScanEat server where they
will be processed computationally with human oversight.

Every day, we witness products being pulled from the shelves due to irregularities in their composition or production.
Unfortunately, this news reaches consumers very slowly, and in some cases, not at all. ScanEat will promptly notify you about all recalled products.

Although the law allows it, we find it unacceptable that manufacturers
can add red dyes to processed meats, sugar to fruit juices, powdered
milk to yogurts, and so on. We also scrutinize the use of additives that
are deemed unsafe for humans by many relevant food safety agencies.

We analyze every product down to the smallest ingredient, highlighting
those problematic ones that consumers would never suspect are hidden
behind perfectly designed packaging.

For each product in the online store, customers can immediately determine
if it is safe for consumption based on their health condition and dietary habits.
By simply scanning the QR code with their ScanEat application, users can load
their ScanEat settings within the online store.

This capability can also be integrated into mobile apps for ordering food
products through deep linking.

The application and our entire system are used anonymously, and we do not
collect any private data that would personally link you to your settings in the application.
