# Gordan Milovac

Hi, I’m Gordan Milovac, a 22-year-old CS & Econ graduate currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Brown University (’26). Originally from Split, Croatia, I was a national team and D1 rower, and I’m now exploring other sports. I’m passionate about nature, photography, robotics, autosport, space, and social media.
