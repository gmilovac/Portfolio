# Gordan Milovac

Hi, my name is Gordan. I’m 20 years old, born in Split, Croatia. Currently a rising junior studying Computer Science & Economics at Brown University. I enjoy coding and am super excited to gain new skills.

My interests are: rowing (currently a D1 rower on the Brown Men’s Crew team), photography, autosport (especially F1), robotics, aerospace and social media.
